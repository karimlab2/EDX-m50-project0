            It's possible the Warriors would be better off spending on the wings
            than up front. The free-agent bigs from Toronto would be splashy, but
            Golden State might get a better return on investment by bolstering its
            wing position. Green and Marquese Chriss can eat up most of the center
            minutes, and Kevon Looney could help immensely if his health cooperates.

            The Golden State Warriors, according to SF Chronicles’ Connor Letourneau
            have been “preparing for years.” What have they been preparing for?
            Well, they’ve been prepping for a blockbuster trade to acquire
            reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo.
            Many sources have reported that Klay Thompson, the second famous splash brother,
            would be tradet to the Milwalkee in this context

            The stakes are at an all-time high for Draymond Green as the Golden State
            Warriors will be relying on him to come back stronger than ever.
            It’s been three years since Draymond Green won his first Defensive Player of the
            Year Award. In the time that has followed, Green’s production for the Golden State
            Warriors has steadily declined. Soon, the Dubs will begin to really hurt from
            Green’s inconsistency.
