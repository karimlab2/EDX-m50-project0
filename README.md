Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

my project is a web site which is a brief presentation of a famous NBA team. It's composed as follows:
-1 an index web page "index.html" that contains the main menu. I used in this page:
	* one mobile-responsive @media query and some.
	* different CSS properties, and some different types of CSS selectors (internal CSS declaration).
2- "Team-presentation.html" : this html page contains both internal and external css declarations. 
	Plus some navigation links as un unordred list.
	the navigation.css included in the head is a result of navigation.scss conversion. the latter contains some nested declaration. 
3- "Players-Presentation.html: contains a table. 
4- "Gallery.html" : Contains some images placed in a grid (Bootstrapâ€™s grid model). it is also responsive.
5- "News.html" : Contains some latest news ( true and fake news). This page include a css file (news.css) 
	which contains a SCSS inheritance (good news and fake one inherit from news-box declaration)
6- "About.html" : the latest page include variable.css (derived from variable.scss) where I give an exemple of variable use in sass.

NB: In all this pages (except the index) there is a set of links used to navigate throught pages.

Thank you.
