        <h1>Golden State Warrior</h1>
        <h2>Short Prsentation</h2>

        <p> The Warriors were founded in 1946 and were originally based in Philadelphia.
            One of the original members of the BAA, the team won the league's
            first championship behind the play of future Hall of Fame forward Joe Fulks,
            the BAA's inaugural scoring leader.</p>
        <p>The Warriors lost in the BAA finals the next season, and in 1949 the team
            became a part of the NBA when the BAA merged with the National Basketball
            League (NBL). The Warriors finished higher than fourth place in their
            division just once in their first six seasons in the new league.
            In 1955–56, however, the Warriors, led by forward Paul Arizin and
            centre Neil Johnston, posted the best record in the league and captured
            their first NBA title.</p>
        <p>In 1959 Philadelphia added local product Wilt Chamberlain,
            who would go on to become one of the greatest players in NBA history.
            While with the Warriors, he famously scored an NBA-record 100 points
            in a 1962 contest, in what would prove to be the team’s final year
            in Philadelphia. A group of San Francisco Bay area investors purchased
            the franchise after the 1961–62 season and moved the team, which became
            known as the San Francisco Warriors.</p>
        <p>The Warriors reached the NBA finals in 1964 with a team dominated
            by Chamberlain and in 1967 with a substantially rebuilt squad that
            featured forward Rick Barry, centre Nate Thurmond, and guard-forward
            Jeff Mullins, only to lose on each occasion. Barry, who had led
            the league in scoring in 1966–67, became one the first stars to
            leave the NBA for the upstart American Basketball Association,
            when he signed with the Oakland Oaks the next year.</p>
